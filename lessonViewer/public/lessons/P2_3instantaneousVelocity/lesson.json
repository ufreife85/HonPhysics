      "- Relate slope on a position–time (x–t) graph to velocity (rise/run = Δx/Δt).",
      "- Distinguish constant, average, and instantaneous velocity and when they are equal.",
      "- Estimate instantaneous velocity on curved x–t graphs using a tangent line (no calculus).",
      "- Sketch and interpret x–t and v–t graphs for simple motions.",

      "steps": [
        "I. Race Context — Changing Velocity",
        "//image _ runner_start.png",
        "- In a sprint, the runner starts from rest (v = 0) in the blocks.",
        "- They quickly increase velocity during the drive phase.",
        "- A well-trained athlete maintains near-top velocity through the finish.",

        "II. Instantaneous Velocity — Definition",
        "- Instantaneous velocity: the velocity at one specific moment in time.",
        "- 1D convention: include direction via sign (e.g., + right/east, − left/west).",
        "- Units: meters per second (m/s).",

        "III. Average vs. Instantaneous vs. Constant Velocity",
        "- Average velocity over an interval: v̄ = Δx / Δt (net change in position per time).",
        "- Constant velocity: same velocity at every instant during the interval.",
        "- If velocity is constant, then instantaneous = average = that constant value.",

        "IV. Position–Time (x–t) Graphs: Slope Means Velocity",
        "- On x–t, vertical change is displacement (Δx), horizontal change is time (Δt).",
        "- The slope (rise/run) equals Δx/Δt and represents the velocity.",
        "- Larger positive slope → larger positive velocity; zero slope → v = 0; negative slope → negative velocity.",

        "V. Constant Velocity on x–t",
        "//image _ xt_constant_80ms.png",
        "- Constant velocity → straight line on x–t (same slope everywhere).",
        "- Example: slope = +80 m/s means the object moves +80 meters each second.",
        "- For this motion, instantaneous velocity = average velocity = +80 m/s at all times.",

        "VI. Changing Velocity (Acceleration) on x–t",
        "- Accelerated motion produces a curved (nonlinear) x–t graph.",
        "- The slope now changes with time, so velocity changes with time.",

        "VII. Average vs. Instantaneous from x–t",
        "- Average velocity on an interval = slope of the secant line joining the two endpoints.",
        "- Instantaneous velocity at a time t = slope of the tangent line at that point.",

        "VIII. Estimating a Tangent Slope (No Calculus)",
        "//image _ tangent_xt.png",
        "- Place a straightedge so it just touches the curve at one point (tangent).",
        "- Choose two readable points on the straightedge, read their (t, x) values.",
        "- Compute slope ≈ Δx/Δt for those two points → instantaneous velocity estimate.",

        "IX. Worked Tangent Estimate (Example)",
        "- Suppose the tangent near t = 4.0 s rises ~170 m over a run of 4.0 s.",
        "- Then v_inst ≈ 170 m / 4.0 s = 42.5 m/s (≈ 43 m/s).",
        "- Interpretation: the object’s instantaneous velocity at that moment is about +43 m/s.",

        "X. Signs, Directions, and Common Pitfalls",
        "- Positive slope → motion in +x; negative slope → motion in −x.",
        "- Flat segments (slope = 0) indicate the object is at rest for that interval.",
        "- Don’t mix up speed (no sign) with velocity (has sign).",
        "- Always include units (m, s, m/s) and sign/direction when appropriate.",

        "XI. From x–t to v–t",
        "- For constant velocity (straight x–t), v–t is a horizontal line at that velocity value.",
        "- For constant acceleration (curved x–t), v–t is a straight sloped line (velocity changes uniformly).",
        "- For “speed up then cruise,” x–t curve steepens then becomes linear; v–t rises then flattens.",

        "XII. Reading Plateaus and Downhill Segments",
        "- Plateau on x–t → v = 0 during that interval (not moving).",
        "- Downhill (x decreases) on x–t → negative velocity; magnitude from the slope.",

        "XIII. Units and Slope Checks",
        "- Slope units on x–t: (meters)/(seconds) = m/s → matches velocity units.",
        "- If your slope comes out in just meters or just seconds, you misread the axes.",
        "- Use convenient grid points to reduce reading error; avoid extremely small runs.",

        "XIV. Quick Strategy for Graph Questions",
        "- 1) Identify the time interval and read x at the endpoints.",
        "- 2) Compute Δx and Δt; include signs.",
        "- 3) Report v̄ = Δx/Δt with units and sign.",
        "- 4) For v_inst at a point: draw/visualize a tangent line and estimate its slope.",

        "XV. Summary",
        "- The slope of x–t is velocity (rise/run = Δx/Δt).",
        "- Constant velocity: straight x–t; instantaneous, average, and constant velocities are equal everywhere.",
        "- With acceleration, use a tangent to estimate instantaneous velocity at a point on x–t."
