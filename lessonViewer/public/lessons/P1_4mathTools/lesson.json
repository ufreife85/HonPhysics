        "A. Scientific Notation",
        "- Method for writing very large or very small numbers compactly.",
        "- Format: coefficient (1–10) × 10ⁿ.",
        "//image _ scientific_notation.png",
        "- Moving the decimal LEFT → positive exponent (e.g., 5,800,000 → 5.8 × 10⁶).",
        "- Moving the decimal RIGHT → negative exponent (e.g., 0.00045 → 4.5 × 10⁻⁴).",

        "B. Significant Figures",
        "- Communicate the precision of a measurement (all certain digits + one estimated digit).",
        "- Rule 1: Non-zero digits are always significant.",
        "- Rule 2: Zeros between non-zero digits are significant (e.g., 50.3 → 3 sig figs).",
        "- Rule 3: Leading zeros are not significant (e.g., 0.0025 → 2 sig figs).",
        "- Rule 4: Trailing zeros are significant only if a decimal point is present (e.g., 150 → 2 sig figs; 150.0 → 4 sig figs).",

        "C. Calculations with Significant Figures",
        "- Multiplication/Division: round result to same sig figs as factor with fewest sig figs.",
        "- Addition/Subtraction: round result to same decimal places as term with fewest decimal places.",

        "II. Physics Equations as Tools",
        "- Equations model relationships between physical quantities.",
        "- Example: v = d / t (speed = distance / time).",
