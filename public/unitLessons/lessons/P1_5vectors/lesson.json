      "- Use right-triangle trigonometry (SOH-CAH-TOA) with vector components.",
      "- Resolve a vector into x- and y-components given magnitude and angle.",
      "- Practice with interactive tools to classify quantities and visualize components."

        "I. Scalars vs. Vectors",
        "- Scalar: quantity with magnitude only. Examples: speed (25 m/s), distance (10 m), mass (5 kg), time (15 s).",

        "B. Using Your Calculator",
        "- Make sure the calculator is in DEGREE mode for these problems.",
        "- To find a side: use sin, cos, or tan with the known angle. (e.g., Opposite = Hypotenuse × sin(θ)).",
        "- To find an angle: use inverse trig (sin⁻¹, cos⁻¹, tan⁻¹). (e.g., θ = sin⁻¹(Opp/Hyp)).",
