    "overview": [
      "I. Lesson Goals",
      "- Define average acceleration as rate of change of velocity: ā = Δv / Δt.",
      "- Interpret signs: positive/negative acceleration relative to motion direction.",
      "- Convert mixed units (km/h ↔ m/s) before computing acceleration.",
      "- Read/relate motion on v–t graphs and connect to acceleration.",
      "- Apply ā = (v_f − v_i)/Δt to real contexts (speeding up, slowing down)."
    ],

    "notes": {
      "steps": [
        "I. Launch Context",
        "//image _ shuttle_atlantis.png",
        "- Space Shuttle Atlantis must rapidly change its velocity to reach orbital speed.",
        "- Any time velocity changes, the motion has acceleration.",

        "II. What Is Average Acceleration?",
        "- Definition: average acceleration ā is change in velocity per unit time.",
        "- Formula: ā = Δv / Δt = (v_f − v_i) / (t_f − t_i).",
        "- SI units: m/s² (meters per second per second).",

        "III. Notation and Units",
        "- v_i: initial velocity; v_f: final velocity; Δt: time interval.",
        "- Keep units consistent. Convert km/h to m/s before using the formula.",
        "- 1 km/h ≈ 0.27778 m/s; 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h.",

        "IV. Vector Nature (Sign Matters)",
        "//image _ accel_signs.png",
        "- Acceleration is a vector in 1D: sign indicates direction along the x-axis.",
        "- Positive acceleration points in +x; negative acceleration points in −x.",
        "- A negative acceleration (sometimes called deceleration) means acceleration is opposite the chosen + direction.",

        "V. Speeding Up vs. Slowing Down",
        "- If an object is moving in +x and speeds up → a > 0.",
        "- If moving in +x and slows down → a < 0 (opposite to motion).",
        "- If moving in −x and speeds up toward −x → a < 0 (same direction as motion).",

        "VI. Skateboarder Example (Direction Focus)",
        "//image _ skateboarder_motion.png",
        "- Moving right (+): slowing to a stop → a is negative.",
        "- Turning left (−) and speeding up → v negative and a negative (same direction).",

        "VII. Average Acceleration from Speeds",
        "- Use ā = (v_f − v_i)/Δt directly when you know start/end velocities and time.",
        "- Example structure: identify v_i, v_f, compute Δv, divide by Δt, include sign/units.",

        "VIII. Mixed Units Example (Why Convert?)",
        "- If v is given in km/h and t in s, convert v to m/s so the result is in m/s².",
        "- Consistent units avoid mistakes and make answers comparable.",

        "IX. v–t Graphs and Acceleration",
        "//image _ vt_pieces.png",
        "- On a velocity–time graph, the slope equals acceleration.",
        "- Positive slope → positive acceleration; negative slope → negative acceleration.",
        "- Flat (horizontal) segment on v–t → a = 0 (constant velocity).",

        "X. Connecting x–t, v–t, and a",
        "- From x–t: slope gives v; changing slope implies changing v → acceleration present.",
        "- From v–t: slope gives a directly; area under v–t gives displacement Δx.",
        "- Average acceleration over an interval equals the slope of the secant line on v–t.",

        "XI. Solving Strategy",
        "- Step 1: Write given values (v_i, v_f, Δt) with signs and units.",
        "- Step 2: Convert units if needed (e.g., km/h → m/s).",
        "- Step 3: Compute Δv = v_f − v_i (keep the sign).",
        "- Step 4: Compute ā = Δv / Δt with units m/s².",
        "- Step 5: Interpret the sign in context (speeding up vs. slowing down).",

        "XII. Common Pitfalls",
        "- Mixing units (km/h with s) → convert first.",
        "- Dropping the sign on Δv or ā.",
        "- Calling any negative ā “deceleration” without considering direction and motion sign.",

        "XIII. Summary",
        "- Average acceleration: ā = Δv/Δt with units m/s².",
        "- Signs encode direction; slowing down in +x gives a negative ā.",
        "- On v–t graphs, slope = acceleration; flats mean a = 0."
