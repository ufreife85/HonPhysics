        "- We draw vectors as arrows: length ∝ magnitude; arrow direction shows the vector’s direction.",
        "- One-dimensional vectors (on a line) add/subtract arithmetically; a negative sign indicates opposite direction.",
        "- Example: +7 and −3 sum to +4.",

        "- Primary visual method for adding 2D vectors.",
        "Step 1: Draw the first vector to scale and direction.",

        "- Order does not matter (commutative: A + B = B + A).",
        "//image _ commutative_property.png",

        "B. Direction (Angle)",
        "- Use inverse trig (often tangent).",
        "- θ = tan⁻¹(opposite/adjacent). For the example, θ ≈ tan⁻¹(50/90) ≈ 29.1°.",
